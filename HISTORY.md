## 0.0.4 (2014-01-15)

* Added CompanyInfo model/service - thank you [Sean Xie](https://github.com/seanxiesx)

## 0.0.3 (2014-01-04)

* All reference types, e.g. Account#parent_ref are implemented via a first-class `BaseReference` instance.
Note: This is a backwards-incompatible change and any existing usages of setting a reference type directly, e.g.

```ruby
account = Quickbooks::Model::Account.new
account.parent_ref = 2
```

The above will fail. The correct usage is now:

```ruby
account = Quickbooks::Model::Account.new
account.parent_id = 2
```

The `_id=` setter will automatically create an instance of the appropriate `ParentRef` in this case.
